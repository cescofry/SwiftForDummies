SwiftForDummies
===============

This is a collection of playgorunds for various examples on the new Swift Language.

I suggest to highlight all the playground file together and then right click them to open on XCode 6 so they will all be in the same sort of workspace. 
Didn't find a more correct way to do so.

Pull requests with corrections or new topics are more than welcome.
